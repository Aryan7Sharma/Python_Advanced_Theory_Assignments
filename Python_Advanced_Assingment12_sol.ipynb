    "Q1. Does assigning a value to a string's indexed character violate Python's string immutability?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> yes In Python, a string is immutable you cannot overwrite the values of immutable objects or you can not modify a value to a string's indexed character. However, you can assign the variable again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Does using the += operator to concatenate strings violate Python's string immutability? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> No += operator does not violate Python's string immutability because we can overwrite any character in a string be append a new character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In Python, how many different ways are there to index a character?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> We can access characters in a String in Two ways : Accessing Characters by Positive Index Number. Accessing Characters by Negative Index Number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the relationship between indexing and slicing?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> Indexing is used to obtain individual elements.while Slicing is used to obtain a sequence of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is an indexed character's exact data type? What is the data form of a slicing-generated substring?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> In string format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the relationship between string and character \"types\" in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> In Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Identify at least two operators and one method that allow you to combine one or more smaller strings to create a larger string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> The most common among them is using the plus (“+”) operator and the multipication(\"*\") operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the benefit of first checking the target string with in or not in before using the index method to find a substring?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> So it will not through an  --(ValueError: substring not found).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Which operators and built-in string methods produce simple Boolean (true/false) results?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol-->Comaprison Operators, and the logical operators (and, or and not) are also referred to as boolean operators. "
