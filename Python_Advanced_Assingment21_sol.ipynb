    "Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> A probability distribution is a list of all of the possible outcomes of a random variable, along with its corresponding probability values. for example in finance be estimating the chance that a given financial asset will fall between or within a specific range, it’s possible to develop trading strategies to capture that predicted outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> Software-generated random numbers only are pseudorandom. They are not truly random because the computer uses an algorithm based on a distribution, and are not secure because they rely on deterministic, predictable algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a \"normal\" probability distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> The two main parameters of a (normal) distribution are the mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol-->  Height of Males--The distribution of the height of males in the U.S. is roughly normally distributed with a mean of 70 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> In a short term i don't think probability distribution will be good enough.The expected value informs about what to expect in an experiment \"in the long run\", after many trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> Strings and tuples are immutable, so using random. shuffle() to modify the original object will raise an error TypeError .\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Describe the math package's general categories of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### sol--> import math\n",
    "###            This module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.\n",

    "Q8. What is the relationship between exponentiation and logarithms?\n",
