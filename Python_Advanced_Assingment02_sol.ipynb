    "    Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sol--> Classes may generate instances (objects) and Modules may be mixed in to classes and other modules, we need to import the particular module before use the classes and methods of that module.for example if we want to use the pre-built sqrt()function then we need to import the math module First then we are able to use that function().\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sol--> To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its __init__ method accepts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Temp:\n",
    "        def __init__(self):\n",
    "            pass\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Q3. Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sol--> Class attributes are attributes which are owned by the class itself. They will be shared by all the instances of the class So the Class attributes are the variables defined directly in the class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    class Sum:\n",
    "        a=1\n",

    "    obj.func1()\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sol--> Instance attributes are attributes or properties attached to an instance of a class. Instance attributes are defined in the constructor.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Q5. What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sol--> The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class. and self is not a  keyword we can use any name for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sol--> The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def temp(a,b):\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Q7. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sol-->\n",
    "              def temp(a,b):\n",
    "                  return a+b:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Q8. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    sol--> A very popular and convenient example is the Addition (+) operator. which i already give in the sol6 and sol7."
